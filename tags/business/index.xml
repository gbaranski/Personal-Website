My plan was to replace it with cheap aliexpress screens, and make some money. Unfortunately I accidently broke fingerprint reader while dissasembling the phone, and because of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve sold it cheaper than I bought it, I lost some money, but I gained skills, and I knew that it won&amp;rsquo;t happen for the next time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t gave up.</description></item><item><title>My second business</title><link>/second-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/second-business/</guid><description>Although I had never smoked cigarettes before, I got interested in e-cigarettes. I was intrigued by the concept of DIY electronics and the competition of chasing the biggest cloud. E-cigarettes are straightforward devices. In the simplest mechanical form, they consist of a high-ampere battery, button, heating coil, and cotton inside it; everything connected and packed into a housing. Pressing a button closes a circuit, which heats the coil and so the cotton inside it; the cotton is soaked in e-liquid that vaporizes at high temperature.</description></item></channel></rss>
