My plan was to replace it with cheap aliexpress screens, and make some money. Unfortunately I accidently broke fingerprint reader while dissasembling the phone, and because of that, I&amp;rsquo;ve sold it cheaper than I bought it, I lost some money, but I gained skills, and I knew that it won&amp;rsquo;t happen for the next time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t gave up.</description></item></channel></rss>
